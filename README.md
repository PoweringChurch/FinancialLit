Pet improvement
* Have pet randomly do things
  * likely just add goals to existing pet class
* also make pet show needs visually. probably just going to be like thought bubbles hovering from head
  * "I'm hungry!", "I'm bored!", "I feel bad...", "I'm sick!"

Saving game

  * json files in clutch

Pretty up the UI
